1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
# Category:  
Crowfunding campaigns have varying success/failed outcome depending on the category. Success rates range from 50-100%. Category *theater* has the most grant total number and most successful campaingns.
# Sub-category:
Crowfunding campaigns have varying success/failed outcome depending on the Sub-category.Sub-Category *plays* has the most grant total number and most successful campaingns.
# Timing:
The timing of a crowdfunding campaign can affect its success. Research shown that most campaigns created on *July*. The campaings that created on June have the highest success rate, while campaings that created on August have the lowest success rate.
# Goal:
 Goal plays a crucial role in the success of crowdfunding campaigns. Research has shown that campaigns that has goal in the range of 15000~49999 tend to have the high success rates above 70%, with less or more goal campaigns being less successful.

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
# Currency:
The pledged amounts in different countries are in differnt currency. It is impossible to analyze the pledged and average donation without more currency information.(Currency is different at different years.)

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
# Name:
We can create a table to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live under per different *name*.
# bankers_count vs timing:
We can create a table with a column of `bankers_count`, rows of `Date Created Conversion`, values based on the sum of `bankers_count`, and filters based on `parent category` and `Years`. It will help analyze the bankers preference of timing.
